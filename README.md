### Project Description
ThinkTank is a video chat based virtual study room designed to revolutionize the way students and professionals collaborate and focus. With synchronized Pomodoro timers, calming break music, goal tracking, and video chat capabilities, it creates an environment that boosts productivity and concentration.

Studying alone or staying focused during group study sessions can often be challenging due to distractions, lack of motivation, and no proper tools to track progress.
